\# Temporal Fairness Metrics

**\*\*Traditional fairness metrics miss 53% of AI bias.\*\*** This library implements four novel metrics that catch temporal discrimination in AI systems.

\#\# The Problem

Your AI system passes all fairness tests. Perfect demographic parity. Equal opportunity across groups. Yet certain users consistently wait longer. Some groups systematically get served last. Traditional metrics are blind to time.

\#\# Real-World Impact

\- **\*\*Michigan Unemployment System\*\***: 40,000 false fraud accusations, 11,000 bankruptcies  
\- **\*\*Optum Healthcare Algorithm\*\***: 200 million Americans affected, Black patients received 50% less care  
\- Both passed traditional fairness tests. Both would have failed temporal fairness checks.

\#\# Quick Start

\`\`\`python  
from temporal\_fairness import TDP, EOOT, FDD, QPF

\# Detect bias in queue positions  
queue\_fairness \= QPF.calculate(queue\_data, protected\_attributes)  
if queue\_fairness \> 0.1:

    print("Warning: Systematic queue position discrimination detected")
