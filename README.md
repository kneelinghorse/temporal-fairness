**Our research reveals that 53% of fairness violations occur in temporal ordering systems** where urgency calculations inadvertently discriminate against protected groups. This repository contains the complete implementation of our temporal fairness framework, including novel metrics, detection algorithms, and mitigation strategies.

## 📊 Key Innovation: Novel Temporal Fairness Metrics

We introduce four mathematically validated metrics for detecting temporal bias:

- **Temporal Demographic Parity (TDP)**: Measures fairness at specific time intervals
- **Equalized Odds Over Time (EOOT)**: Ensures consistent accuracy across temporal windows  
- **Queue Position Fairness (QPF)**: Quantifies systematic ordering bias
- **Fairness Decay Detection (FDD)**: Monitors metric degradation over 6-12 months

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from temporal_fairness import FairnessDetector, TemporalMetrics

# Initialize detector
detector = FairnessDetector()

# Load your temporal data
data = load_temporal_dataset("healthcare_triage.csv")

# Calculate temporal fairness metrics
metrics = TemporalMetrics()
tdp_score = metrics.temporal_demographic_parity(data)
qpf_score = metrics.queue_position_fairness(data)

# Detect bias patterns
violations = detector.detect_temporal_bias(data)
print(f"Temporal bias detected: {violations.severity}")
print(f"Affected groups: {violations.impacted_demographics}")

# Apply mitigation
mitigated_data = detector.mitigate_bias(data, strategy="adversarial_debiasing")
```
