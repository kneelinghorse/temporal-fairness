## **The Pattern Seeker: A Personal Journey from Burnout to Breakthrough**

There's a particular kind of exhaustion that comes not from the work itself, but from fighting systems that resist common sense. I know because I lived it.

In 2018-2019, I was helping build what was then a state-of-the-art data platform—designed by data professionals, for data professionals, tailored specifically for production data science. We were solving real problems, building something that mattered. The technical challenges were exhilarating. The platform was elegant. The impact was real.

But the toll of the constant pivots and hard struggles had taken its toll. I tried a new role at Paylocity, hoping to find a way to help business software find its way to AI but the same forces of inertia existed there and I hit a wall. Not a technical wall—those I could climb. This was different. Software had become hard not because the problems were hard to solve, but because the people and processes had turned simple things into Sisyphean tasks. Every good idea had to pass the right gatekeepers or align with preconceived ideas. But mostly, it had to fit into a quarterly planning cycle, doing big things is really difficult because organizations (imo) don’t know how to scale or do big things. Every elegant solution got compromised into complexity. I watched as bureaucracy strangled innovation, and my cynicism grew until it consumed my enthusiasm.

So I walked away.

Not dramatically. Not with some grand plan. I just... stopped. After twenty years in digital design and UX, I needed to remember who I was outside of sprint planning and stakeholder meetings. I returned to my roots—art and music. Started a small business. Made things with my hands instead of pixels. The art business would never make me rich, might barely keep the lights on, but it gave me something I'd lost: the pure joy of creation without the bullshit of product development lifecycles.

The healing happened slowly. Away from the pressure, my mind began to see patterns again—not in dashboards and user flows, but in broader strokes. The big picture that had been obscured by burnout started coming back into focus.

Then, about eight months ago, my wife asked for help with an AI project for her work. I'd played with LLMs before—silly experiments, deep searches on random topics, nothing serious. But this time was different. ChatGPT had evolved. Not just incrementally—it was noticeably, remarkably better.

My mind, dormant for so long, suddenly lit up with possibilities.

At first, I resisted returning to my old world. I explored every other path—new businesses, consulting gigs, anything but UX. I even built a production-grade DEX aggregator called Aquex.ai, a real application that could become a real business. But I knew what I was really doing: proving to myself that I wasn't broken. That my skills hadn't atrophied. That I could still create, still solve problems, still see patterns others missed.

And I could.

Without realizing it, I'd developed something unexpected: a two-person scrum routine with AI. Me and Claude, shipping software every session. No committees. No compromise. Just pure creation at the speed of thought. I'd gone so far to avoid my UX background that I'd accidentally revolutionized my own development process.

That's when I knew I couldn't keep running from twenty years of experience. But I also couldn't go back to the old ways.

So I returned to the challenge that had haunted me since leaving: How do you build a truly great data platform? How can I build a better design system? One based on UX and data-first principles, but enhanced by everything I'd learned working with AI? How do you create a new way of building—one where AI and humans truly collaborate, where humans remain essential partners, not passive observers?

The insight came from a simple observation: Most software is built from the same pieces, assembled in remarkably similar ways. Our data structures repeat. Our patterns converge. I started comparing sites—Stripe flows, payment systems, user management—and found something stunning: 72.2% similarity across seemingly different applications.

Everyone was solving the same problems, building the same patterns, but nobody could see the forest for the trees.

That became Project Morpheus—our attempt to see how far semantic patterns and contextual understanding could take us. If software components could describe themselves, if patterns could be recognized and reused, if context could drive generation... how deep did this rabbit hole go?

The answer: deeper than we imagined.

Each discovery led to another. The Semantic Protocol made patterns visible. Morpheus made them actionable. And then, while analyzing thousands of these patterns, we found something nobody was looking for: temporal unfairness. Hidden discrimination based not on who you are, but when you interact with systems.

There's no dramatic origin story here. No lightning strike of inspiration. No mystical moment of clarity. Just a burnt-out UX leader who needed to step away to see clearly again, who found an AI partner that could keep up with his pattern-seeking brain, and who stumbled upon systemic problems hiding in plain sight.

The art still keeps me grounded. My brain still needs both the calm of creation and the stimulation of problem-solving. But now, instead of fighting systems, I'm building new ones. Instead of compromising with committees, I'm collaborating with AI. Instead of burning out, I'm lighting fires.

Sometimes you have to leave to truly arrive. Sometimes the patterns you need to see only become visible from a distance. And sometimes, the best discoveries come not from looking for something new, but from finally having the tools—and the perspective—to see what was always there.
