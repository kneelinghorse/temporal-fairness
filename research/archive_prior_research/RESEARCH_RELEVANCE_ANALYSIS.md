## Recommendations

### Files to Definitely Keep (1-5)
These files directly inform our temporal fairness implementation and should be actively referenced during development.

### Files to Keep for Reference (6-9)
These provide valuable context and future enhancement ideas but aren't critical for core functionality.

### File to Consider Removing (10)
The federated learning file, while interesting, doesn't directly apply to our centralized temporal fairness framework.

## Key Insights to Implement Immediately

1. **Population Stability Index (PSI)** - Add to FDD for early warning
2. **Quantile Demographic Drift (QDD)** - Enable label-free monitoring
3. **Inspection Paradox Detection** - Add to bias detector
4. **Time-of-Day Bias Analysis** - Implement in temporal analyzer
5. **Circular Buffer Optimization** - Update sliding windows to O(1)
6. **Exponential Urgency Scoring** - Use 1/(time_factor²) formula

## Research-Based Enhancements Already Implemented

Based on the research analysis, I've created `enhanced_bias_detector.py` which includes:
- Inspection paradox detection
- Proxy variable discrimination analysis
- Population Stability Index calculation
- Quantile Demographic Drift monitoring
- Time-of-day bias detection
- Research-based urgency scoring

This ensures our implementation incorporates the latest research findings for production-ready temporal fairness monitoring.
