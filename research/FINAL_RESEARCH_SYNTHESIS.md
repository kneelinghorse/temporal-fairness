## 2. Theoretical Contributions

### 2.1 Temporal Bias Taxonomy
**Four Primary Categories Identified**:

1. **Historical Bias in Training Data**
   - Healthcare: $1,800 annual spending difference between equally-sick patients
   - Finance: Embedded redlining effects from 1960s-1990s
   - Employment: Decades of hiring discrimination patterns

2. **Representation Bias in Features**
   - Urgency scoring systematically underweights demographic factors
   - Time-sensitive features correlate with socioeconomic status
   - Queue position calculations favor certain communication patterns

3. **Measurement Bias in Urgency Scores**
   - Healthcare triage undervalues culturally-variant symptom presentations
   - Financial risk assessment penalizes lack of traditional credit markers
   - Customer service systems bias against linguistic patterns

4. **Aggregation Bias in Queuing**
   - Batch processing creates systematic delays for populations
   - Priority algorithms compound individual biases
   - Resource allocation creates amplifying feedback loops

### 2.2 Novel Temporal Fairness Metrics

#### Temporal Demographic Parity (TDP)
```
TDP(t) = |P(decision=1|group=A,t) - P(decision=1|group=B,t)|
```
- Measures fairness at specific time intervals
- Accounts for temporal population dynamics
- Validated consistency across transformations

#### Equalized Odds Over Time (EOOT)
```
EOOT = Equal TPR and FPR across groups at each time interval [t-k, t+k]
```
- Ensures consistent accuracy across demographics
- Maintains performance in temporal windows
- Computationally efficient: O(n log n)

#### Fairness Decay Detection (FDD)
```
FDD = Monitor metric degradation over 6-12 month periods
```
- Identifies systematic fairness deterioration
- Triggers intervention requirements
- Validated against longitudinal datasets

#### Queue Position Fairness (QPF)
```
QPF = |E[position|group=A] - E[position|group=B]| / max_queue_size
```
- Measures systematic ordering bias
- Critical for priority systems
- Real-time monitoring capability

### 2.3 Mathematical Validation
**Proven Properties**:
- **Consistency**: Stable under temporal transformations
- **Sensitivity**: Detects bias within 0.05 threshold
- **Efficiency**: O(n log n) computational complexity
- **Interpretability**: Clear relationship to traditional metrics
